//! Implementation of the common functions for BTF bridge canisters. The main entry point is
//! [`BridgeCanister`] trait that should be implemented by a canister to include common APIs and
//! functions.
//!
//! The crate also provides [`bridge_inspect`] function that provides common `inspect_message` logic
//! for common bridge APIs.
//!
//! [`build_data`] macro can be used to provide canister build data in the common format.
