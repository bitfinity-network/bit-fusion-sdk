# Bridge Deployer

Bridge Deployer is a CLI tool for deploying and managing various types of bridge contracts on the Internet Computer and Ethereum networks.

## Requirements

- Rust
- Forge CLI Installed
- dfx (only for **local** deployment)

## Installation

Build the project using the following commands:

```bash
cargo build -p bridge-deployer --release
```

## Usage

The general syntax for using the Bridge Deployer is:

```bash
./bridge-deployer [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
```

## Commands

- `deploy`: Deploy a new bridge
- `upgrade`: Upgrade an existing bridge
- `reinstall`: Reinstall a bridge

## Global Options

- `--identity <IDENTITY_PATH>`: Path to the identity file
- `--private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>`: Private Key of the wallet to use for the transaction (can be provided as an environment variable `PRIVATE_KEY`)
- `--evm-network <EVM_NETWORK>`: EVM network to deploy the contract to (e.g. "mainnet", "testnet", "localhost")
- `--canister-ids <PATH_TO_CANISTER_IDS>`: Path to the file containing the canister ids
- `-v, --verbosity`: Set the verbosity level (use multiple times for higher levels)
- `-q, --quiet`: Silence all output

## Bridge Types

- Rune
- ICRC
- ERC20
- BTC
- BRC20

## Deployment

For the deployment of canisters, you will require to have/create a wallet canister which will be used to deploy the bridge canister. The wallet canister should have enough ICPs to cover the deployment cost and the cycles required for the bridge canister to be operational.

For the deployment, you will need to provide the wallet canister id as `--wallet-canister` or as an environment variable `WALLET_CANISTER`.

Command to deploy a bridge canister:

```bash
./bridge-deployer
  -vvv \
  --evm-network localhost \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --identity path/to/identity.pem \
  --evm <EVM_PRINCIPAL> \
  deploy \
  --wasm path/to/rune_bridge.wasm \
  --wallet-canister <WALLET_CANISTER> \
  rune \
  --owner <ADMIN_PRINCIPAL> \
  --min-confirmations 6 \
  --indexer-urls <https://indexer1.com,https://indexer2.com,https://indexer3.com> \
  --deposit-fee 1000000 \
  --mempool-timeout 3600 \
  --signing-key-id dfx \
  --bitcoin-network <bitcoin_network> \
  --indexer-consensus-threshold 3
```

For more detailed information on each command and its options, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
./bridge-deployer --help
```

## Upgrading a Bridge

To upgrade a bridge, you will need to provide the canister id of the bridge to be upgraded. The command is similar to the commands shown above, with the addition of the `--canister-id` argument.

```bash
./bridge-deployer upgrade [BRIDGE_TYPE] --wasm <WASM_PATH> --canister-id <CANISTER_ID>
```

## Reinstalling a Bridge

To reinstall a bridge, you will need to provide the canister id of the bridge to be reinstalled. The command is similar to the deployment command, with the addition of the `--canister-id` argument.

```bash
bridge-deployer reinstall [BRIDGE_TYPE] --canister-id <PRINCIPAL> --wasm <WASM_PATH> --bft-bridge <ADDRESS>
```

Note: You need to provide the canister arguments for the bridge type you are reinstalling.

### Bridge-Specific Deployment Examples

#### ICRC Bridge

```bash
bridge-deployer -vvv \
  --evm-network mainnet \
  --identity <IDENTITY_PATH> \
  deploy \
  --wasm ./icrc_bridge.wasm \
  --wallet-canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai \
  icrc \
  --signing-key-id production \
  --owner 2vxsx-fae \
  --evm <EVM_PRINCIPAL> \
  --log-filter "trace" # You can set the log filter to "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
```

The other bridges are more or less similar to the ICRC bridge, with the only difference being the arguments required for the specific bridge type. You can refer to the help text for each bridge type for more information.

Note: The examples above are for illustrative purposes only. Please replace the placeholders with the actual values.

### Extra Information

For the upgrade process, only the canister will be upgraded. The BFT contract will remain the same, hence the BFT contract should be deployed separately in case it requires an upgrade.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, double check all the arguments provided and ensure that the wallet canister has enough ICPs to cover the deployment cost as well as the Ethereum address.
- If the deployment fails, check the error message for more information on the cause of the failure.
